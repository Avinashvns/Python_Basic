        "**1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?**\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is known for its simple and readable syntax, which makes it easy for beginners to learn and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Why is Python Popular :-**\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Easy to Learn – Python has simple and clear syntax, similar to English, which makes coding easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Large Community Support – It has a huge global community, so help and resources are easily available.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Rich Libraries and Frameworks – Python provides powerful tools like Django, Flask, and NumPy that make development faster and easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Wide Applications – It is used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and automation.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - High Job Demand – Python developers are in high demand because many industries use Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is an interpreter in Python ?**\n",
        "  - An interpreter is a program that executes Python code line by line. It reads the source code written by the programmer, converts it into machine-understandable instructions, and runs it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In Python, the interpreter translates and executes each statement one at a time, which makes debugging easier. If there is an error in the code, the interpreter stops execution and shows the error message at that line.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?**\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are special reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language. These keywords are used to define the structure and syntax of Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - We cannot use keywords as variable names, function names, or identifiers because they are already reserved by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Examples of some Python keywords are:**\n",
        "\n",
        "        if         else        elif        for         \n",

        "        False      None        while\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?**\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words that have special meanings in the Python programming language. They are used to define the structure and syntax of the program, such as conditions (if, else), loops (for, while), and functions (def).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If we try to use a keyword as a variable name, Python will give a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "        if = 10   # This will give an error\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is mutability in Python ?**\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed or modified after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If the value of an object can be changed after creation, it is called mutable. If the value cannot be changed, it is called immutable.\n",

        "**6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?**\n",
        "  - Lists are mutable because their elements can be changed, added, or removed after the list is created. This makes lists flexible and useful when we need to modify data frequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "          my_list[0] = 10   # Value can be changed\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Tuples are immutable because once they are created, their elements cannot be changed. This makes tuples faster and more secure compared to lists. Tuples are generally used when the data should not be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "            my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n",

        "\n",
        "    1. == (Equality Operator)\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The == operator checks whether the values of two objects are equal.\n",
        "    It compares the content of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Example:\n",

        "    2. is (Identity Operator)\n",
        "\n",
        "      - The is operator checks whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "      It compares the memory location of the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Example:\n",

        "8**. What are logical operators in Python ?**\n",
        "  - Logical operators in Python are used to combine multiple conditions and return a Boolean result (True or False). They are mainly used in decision-making statements like if conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Python has three logical operators:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. and - Returns True if both conditions are true.\n",
        "\n",

        "          a = 10\n",
        "          b = 5\n",
        "          print(a > 5 and b < 10)   # True\n",
        "    2. or - Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          a = 10\n",
        "          b = 5\n",
        "          print(a > 20 or b < 10)   # True\n",
        "    3. not - Reverses the result. If the condition is True, it returns False, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "            a = 10\n",

        "\n",
        "**9. What is type casting in Python ?**\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another data type. It is used when we want to change the type of a variable to perform specific operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **There are two types of type casting in Python:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. Implicit Type Casting - It is done automatically by Python when converting a smaller data type to a larger data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          a = 5      # int\n",
        "          b = 2.5    # float\n",
        "          c = a + b  # int is automatically converted to float\n",
        "    2. Explicit Type Casting - It is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like:\n",
        "\n",
        "          int()\n",
        "\n",
        "          float()\n",

        "          str()\n",
        "\n",
        "          bool()\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          x = \"10\"\n",
        "          y = int(x)   # converting string to integer\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?**\n",
        "  - Type casting means converting one data type into another. In Python, it can be done in two ways: implicit and explicit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Implicit Type Casting\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Done automatically by Python.\n",

        "**11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?**\n",
        "  - Conditional statements in Python are used to make decisions in a program. They allow the program to execute certain blocks of code only when a specific condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - In simple words, conditional statements help the program decide what to do next based on a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Python provides the following conditional statements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - if\n",
        "\n",
        "    - if-else\n",
        "\n",
        "    - if-elif-else\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "          age = 18\n",
        "\n",
        "          if age >= 18:\n",

        "\n",
        "    - In this example, the program checks the condition (age >= 18).\n",
        "    - If it is true, one block of code runs; otherwise, another block runs.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**12. How does the elif statement work ?**\n",
        "  - The elif statement stands for “else if”. It is used to check multiple conditions after an if statement. If the first condition is false, Python checks the elif condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - If the elif condition is true, its block of code will execute. If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if given) will execute.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "        marks = 75\n",

        "\n",
        "        If not, Python checks elif (marks >= 60) → Grade B\n",

        "\n",
        "  - For example, when asking a user to enter the correct password, we do not know how many attempts the user will take. The loop should continue until the correct password is entered.\n",
